# DDD Patterns with Clean Architecture

## Introduction

Welcome to the "DDD Patterns with Clean Architecture" project. This initiative represents a study case where we combine the best practices from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with principles of Clean Architecture.

The aim is to showcase how these strategies can work together to create a robust, maintainable, and scalable software system. By exploring key concepts of DDD and Clean Architecture, this project serves as a practical guide for developers who aspire to improve their software design skills.

Stay tuned as we navigate through the intricacies of these powerful software design methodologies. Your questions, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome!

## Stack

In the **"DDD Patterns with Clean Architecture"** project, we have utilized a combination of technologies to achieve our goals. These choices were made to ensure that our project is robust, scalable, and maintainable. Here's a brief overview of our technology stack:

### TypeScript

For the project's main language, we chose TypeScript. TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It brings a new level of reliability and development experience by introducing static types, interfaces, and classes to JavaScript, which aligns well with our aim to implement a Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

Using TypeScript has allowed us to enforce a certain level of correctness at compile-time and make our codebase more understandable and easier to refactor, key benefits in a DDD environment where domain complexity can grow quite significantly.

### Sequelize

As part of our backend infrastructure, we've incorporated the Sequelize library. Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication, and more.

However, for the purposes of this study case, we are utilizing Sequelize with an in-memory database. This approach allows us to easily simulate database operations without the need for a separate database setup, making the project more accessible to developers who want to quickly run and study the project without having to deal with database setup.

### Jest

Testing is a critical aspect of any application, helping to ensure the correctness of our codebase and improving its maintainability. For this reason, we've integrated Jest as our testing framework of choice in the **"DDD Patterns with Clean Architecture"** project.

Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It provides a comprehensive set of features, such as a simple API for structuring your tests, snapshots for capturing and comparing UI changes, an easy setup and teardown mechanism for tests, and seamless parallelization of test runs.

Using Jest, we're able to write unit tests for our individual components and integration tests to verify the interaction between them. It also allows us to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD), a cornerstone practice in the DDD approach.
